  prologue:
    'You have spent a long time looking at the ground.\n\nIt was necessary, perhaps. You had to watch your step. You had to count your resources. You had to survive. But somewhere along the way, the habit of looking down became a posture of the soul. You began to believe that the world was small, that possibilities were finite, and that safety was more important than flight.\n\nBut today, the air changes.\n\nYou wake up not in your bed, but on a rocky plateau at the base of a structure that defies logic. It is a mountain, but it is not made of rough stone. It is formed of translucent quartz, gold veins, and hardened light. It pierces the cloud layer above you, vanishing into a sky so blue it hums.\n\nThis is the Spire of Vision.\n\nThe wind here is crisp and thin. It smells of ozone and pine resin. It strips away the heaviness you brought with you, tugging at your clothes, demanding that you lift your head.\n\nTz’ikin is the Eagle, the Bird of Prosperity, and the Master of Vision. It is the energy that governs the ability to see the whole picture. In the world below, prosperity is often confused with hoarding—keeping things close, counting coins in the dark. But here, in the high air, you learn the truth: Prosperity is a flow. It is the natural consequence of seeing clearly.\n\nYou check your pockets. They are empty. But you do not feel poor. You feel light.\n\nA feather drifts down from the clouds above. It is huge, shimmering with iridescence—indigo shifting to gold. It lands at your feet, pointing toward a narrow, winding path that ascends the Spire.\n\nYou understand the invitation. You are not here to climb a mountain. You are here to learn how to fly.\n\nThe journey of the next thirteen days is an ascent. You will leave the heavy atmosphere of scarcity and limited thinking. You will climb until the air is rare and your vision is wide. You will meet the guardians of the high peaks—the Owl who forgives, the Storm that cleanses, the Sun that empowers, and the Wind that carries you.\n\nYou take a deep breath, filling your lungs with the altitude. Your old life feels small and distant down in the valley.\n\nYou take the first step up. The wind rushes to meet you, whispering one word:\n\n*Rise.*',
  epilogue:
    'You stand at the absolute summit of the Spire.\n\nThe world below is a tapestry of unimaginable beauty. From this height, you cannot see the cracks in the pavement or the dust on the floor. You see the patterns. You see how the rivers feed the forests, how the storms clear the air, how the shadows define the light.\n\nYou see the connections.\n\nThe Eagle spirit, the great Tz’ikin, circles above you one last time, its golden wings spanning the horizon. It lets out a cry that vibrates in your chest—a sound of pure triumph and freedom. Then, it dives, dissolving into the golden light of the sun.\n\nYou are alone on the peak, but you are not lonely. You are full.\n\nYou have walked the path of the Visionary. You began by accepting the spark of prosperity. You forgave the past with the Owl, solved the puzzles of the mind, cut the cords of limitation, and weathered the storm of rebirth. You stood in the hero’s light, reflected in the dream-water, and learned to ride the wind. You endured the darkness before dawn, gathered the harvest, channeled the serpent’s power, and understood the necessity of death.\n\nAnd finally, here at the top, you stood with the Deer in the wild silence of ascension.\n\nYou look at your hands. They are still empty of objects, yet you know you possess everything. You carry the vision. And because you carry the vision, the resources will follow you wherever you go. You are no longer chasing abundance; you are generating it.\n\nIt is time to descend.\n\nBut you do not go back down as the person who climbed up. You do not return to the valley to shrink back into smallness. You return as an emissary of the heights.\n\nYou begin the walk down, moving with the easy grace of gravity working with you. The air gets thicker, warmer. The sounds of the world return.\n\nWhen your feet touch the valley floor, the dust is the same. The noise is the same. The problems are the same.\n\nBut you look up.\n\nYou see the peak piercing the clouds, and you smile.\n\nYou know the way to the sky now.\n\nAnd you know that the view from up there is the truth.',

      chapter:
        'The path begins in a mist that smells of morning rain. You cannot see the top of the Spire; you can only see the few steps in front of you. The quartz beneath your boots is slippery with dew.\n\nSuddenly, the mist parts. Not slowly, but violently, as if a giant wing has swept it aside.\n\nStanding on a ridge above you is a Bird of prey, larger than a man. Its feathers are not made of keratin, but of gold leaf and sapphire. It looks at you with an eye that is sharp, unblinking, and fiercely intelligent.\n\n1 is the Spark. Tz’ikin is the Vision.\n\nThe Bird screeches, a sound that pierces your eardrums and wakes up every nerve ending in your body. It is asking you a question without words: *What do you see?*\n\nYou look around. You see rocks. You see fog.\n\nThe Bird clacks its beak impatiently. It wants you to look *better*.\n\nYou close your eyes and take a breath. You let go of the physical details and look with your inner eye. You sense the potential of the mountain. You sense the energy rising. You sense that this path leads to something magnificent.\n\nWhen you open your eyes, the Bird is gone. But where it stood, a single golden coin rests on the rock. It is not currency from any nation you know. It is stamped with the image of an open eye.\n\nYou pick it up. It is warm. It hums against your palm.\n\nYou realize that this is the seed of your prosperity. It is not a lot—just one coin, one spark, one moment of clarity. But it is enough to begin.\n\nYou pocket the coin. As you do, the fog lifts completely for a hundred yards. The path is clear.\n\nYou have initiated the cycle. You have chosen to see.',

All of it is cooking in the pot of the night.\n\nShadows move around you—the doubts of "Am I ready?" and "Is it real?" You greet them. They are just the guardians of the threshold. You are not afraid of the dark anymore because you know what is coming.\n\nA faint line of purple appears in the east. The gestation is almost over.\n\nYou stand up. You turn your face toward the light that isn’t there yet, but you know is coming. This is faith.\n\nYou are ready to be born.',
