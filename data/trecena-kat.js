  prologue:
    'The horizon shifts from the cool blues of the previous world into a deep, resonant amber. You find yourself standing at the rim of a colossal canyon, carved not by water, but by gravity and time.\n\nStretching across the expanse, anchored to the towering cliff walls, are thousands of massive, golden nets. They overlap and intersect, forming a complex, suspended landscape of woven walkways, hanging hammocks, and floating storage silos. The air glimmers with dust motes that look like trapped starlight.\n\nThis is the Valley of the Gathered.\n\nK’at is the Net—the energy that catches, collects, and holds. It is the harvest bag, the fishing net, and the tangled web of our own thoughts and possessions. In the world below, nets are used to trap things. Here, the net is a filter.\n\nYou look closer. The nets are not empty. They are filled with objects glowing with faint light: memories, unfulfilled promises, tools you never used, dreams you set aside, relationships you outgrew but never released. Some of the bundles look heavy, weighing down the fibers. Others float, light as bubbles.\n\nYou realize, with a sudden heaviness in your own chest, that this is your collection. You have been carrying all of this, invisible, on your back. Now, the canyon has externalized it so you can finally see what you hold.\n\nThe wind here is warm and smells of dry grass and old paper. It whispers through the ropes, a sound like a thousand hushed conversations.\n\nYou have not come here to be trapped. You have come here to sort.\n\nTo cross the canyon, you must walk the nets. You must navigate the abundance and the clutter of your own life. You must decide what is a harvest to be consumed, what is a seed to be planted, and what is dead weight that must be cut loose.\n\nThe ropes hum under your feet, responsive and taut. They are waiting for you to lighten the load.\n\nYou take a step onto the woven path. The canyon sways gently, holding you. It is time to see what you have gathered.',
  epilogue:
    'You reach the far rim of the canyon just as the amber light begins to deepen into a rich, velvety twilight. You turn back to look at the distance you have crossed.\n\nThe Valley of the Gathered looks different now. The chaotic tangles of the first days are gone. The nets hang in graceful, intentional curves. The heaviness is gone, replaced by a sense of spaciousness. The bundles that remain are glowing brightly—true abundance, not clutter.\n\nYou look at your hands. They feel free. You look at your spirit. It feels unburdened.\n\nYou have walked the path of the Net. You have faced the serpent of vitality, the death of old patterns, the stability of the wilderness, and the ripening of true seeds. You have paid your spiritual debts, stayed loyal to your truth, woven your own artistry, and walked the road of destiny. You have built your inner pillar, touched the magic of the earth, and seen the vision from above.\n\nAnd finally, you have forgiven.\n\nThe last knot has been untied. The last unnecessary weight has been dropped into the abyss below, turning into compost for the valley floor.\n\nK’at has taught you the difference between holding on and hoarding. It has shown you that true abundance requires space. You cannot receive the new if your hands are full of the old.\n\nA cool breeze rises from the canyon, carrying the scent of rain and wet earth. The golden nets dissolve slowly into the air, turning into drifting sparks.\n\nYou are no longer a collector of burdens. You are a harvester of light.\n\nYou turn toward the horizon, where the first stars of the next cycle are beginning to shine. You are light. You are open. You are ready to receive.',

      chapter:
        'You step tentatively onto the first woven walkway. The rope is thick, made of golden fibers that feel warm to the touch. Below you, the canyon floor is miles down, hidden in shadow. Around you, the nets are cluttered with debris.\n\nThis is the Net of Accumulation.\n\nBundles hang everywhere. Some are labeled with dates from years ago. Some pulse with anxiety. Some are heavy sacks of "Maybe someday" and "What if." The path forward is blocked by a massive, tangled knot of cables and cords, vibrating with a low, dissonant hum.\n\n1 is the number of Beginnings. K’at is the Net. Today, you must acknowledge the trap before you can find the treasure.\n\nYou realize that you have been hoarding energy. You have said "yes" when you meant "no." You have kept relationships on life support. You have stored resentments in the attic of your mind. The knot before you is the physical manifestation of your overwhelmed spirit.\n\nYou cannot cut it—that would sever the bridge. You must loosen it.\n\nYou reach into the tangle. The ropes are tight, pulling against each other. You find a single strand that feels distinct—a small worry you pick up every morning out of habit. You acknowledge it. "I am holding this," you whisper.\n\nThe moment you name it, the tension in that strand releases. It goes slack. The knot loosens, just a fraction.\n\nYou find another strand. "I am holding this old expectation." It relaxes.\n\nThis is the work of the first day: simple acknowledgment. You don’t have to fix the whole mess today. You just have to admit that you are carrying it. You have to stop pretending your hands are empty.\n\nAs the knot loosens, a gap opens in the path. It is just wide enough for you to squeeze through.\n\nYou step through the opening, leaving a little bit of the tightness behind. The net sways, adjusting to your lighter weight.',

You have been carrying these transforming parts of yourself, thinking they were burdens, but they were incubators.\n\nThe wind picks up, swirling the dust of the empty shells. It clears the air. The chrysalis that shook cracks open.

Some are bright, ready to burst.\n\nA Rabbit made of soft white light hops across the net. It stops at a dim sphere and nudges it. The sphere glows brighter.\n\nYou understand the work of the day. You must tend the seeds. You cannot just collect them; you must empower them.\n\nYou find a sphere that holds a creative dream you abandoned. It is cold. You cup your hands around it. You pour your energy (5) into the seed (Q’anil). You imagine it growing, blooming, bearing fruit.\n\nThe sphere warms up. It turns from dull grey to brilliant gold. The light spreads, illuminating the path ahead.\n\nYou realize that your "collection" is not just past burdens; it is future gardens. But a garden in a net cannot grow without attention. You must choose which seeds to water.\n\nYou spend the time touching the spheres that matter to you, waking them up. The canyon begins to glow with the light of a thousand awakened stars.',
