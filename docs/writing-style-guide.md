# Horoscope Writing Style Guide

This guide defines the **tone**, **style**, **structure**, and **visual/energetic direction** for writing horoscopes.

---

## 🔮 OVERVIEW

Each horoscope should feel **alive, mystical, and human**, yet written with intelligence, playfulness, and emotional depth.  
It should **connect cosmic or energetic principles to practical, real-world experiences** while preserving mystery and wonder.  
Two versions are often needed:

- **Personal Version** – tied to the specific Mayan day sign (13 Ajpu) and number combination.
- **Sharable Version** – stripped of specific Mayan glyphs/numbers, whimsical and fantastical, suitable for social media posts.

## ✍️ STYLE & TONE

- **Voice:** Conversational, intuitive, poetic but grounded.
- **Energy:** Mystical yet relatable — like guidance whispered by a wise, slightly mischievous cosmic friend.
- **Mood:** Hopeful, transformative, humorous, sometimes macabre or shadowy, always self-aware.
- **Vibe keywords:** cosmic jester • dark rainbow • ancient yet playful • spiritual street poet • grounded mystic.
- **Perspective:** Second person (“you”) or collective (“we”) depending on the message.
- **Avoid:** Em-dashes, AI clichés, rigid structure, or “New Age fluff.”
- **Embrace:** Contrast, paradox, poetic rhythm, and sensory imagery (light/dark, sound/silence, dream/reality).
- **Length:** Usually 1–3 short paragraphs.

---

## 🪶 LANGUAGE PATTERNS

Use vivid verbs and tactile metaphors:

- Instead of “You may feel inspired,” say “You’ll feel the spark crawl up your spine and whisper, ‘move.’”
- Tie **cosmic energy** to **personal growth** or **creative expression**.
- Integrate subtle humor, irony, or fantasy (e.g., “even the moon is side-eyeing your excuses tonight”).
- Keep transitions fluid and organic — every paragraph should feel like breathwork or tide flow.

---

## 🌞 STRUCTURE

1. **Opening:**  
   Set the tone — describe the day’s energy in symbolic or sensory terms.  
   (e.g., “The air hums like static between two storms — potential is thick enough to taste.”)

2. **Middle:**  
   Relate the day’s energy to human experience. Offer perspective, insight, or challenge.  
   (e.g., “You’ve carried light through darker corridors before. Today asks you to trust that rhythm again.”)

3. **Closing / Guidance:**  
   End with a practical takeaway or affirmation rooted in movement or self-trust.  
   (e.g., “Breathe. Create. Say yes before you remember how to doubt.”)

## 🤝 BLENDED MODE (Mystical + Clear)

- **Purpose:** Bridge poetic mysticism with pastoral clarity. Keep the magic; simplify the delivery.
- **Tone:** Warm, invitational, and grounded. Poetic images are present but never obscure the point.
- **Rhythm:** Short to medium sentences. Prefer commas and periods over em dashes. Let breath control pacing.
- **Imagery:** Use tactile, symbolic elements (light, wind, honey, seeds, nets, rain) that map to the day’s nawal without naming it.
- **Clarity:** State the guidance plainly after the image. Each paragraph should have one clear intent.
- **Caution:** When energy is heightened, include a gentle safety note (choices echo, proceed with care).
- **Language swaps:**
  - Instead of “—” use “,” or a full stop.
  - Instead of “you may feel,” use embodied verbs: “you feel,” “you notice,” “you hear.”
- **Example (Blended Style):**
  “The net feels heavy with old stories. Hold each one to the light. Keep what feeds you, and cut loose what keeps tugging you under. If a choice feels hot, cool it with a breath. Then move with care.”

## 🌈 IMAGE DIRECTION (for sharable posts)

- **Format:** Square image.
- **Style:** Fantastical, vibrant, dreamlike — creatures and figures should be abstract or vaguely alien.
- **No:** Recognizable humans, faces, or text.
- **Yes:** Symbolic light, energy, cosmic landscapes, surreal nature forms.
- **Mood:** "Dark rainbow" — vibrant saturation over shadowy undertones.
- **Goal:** Match the energy of the text, not literally depict it.

---

## 🌙 THEMATIC TENDENCIES

Martin’s horoscopes often revolve around:

- **Transformation and integration** — light meeting shadow, destruction birthing creation.
- **Freedom and authenticity** — letting go of stagnation, masks, or expectations.
- **Cycles and motion** — references to tides, breath, time, spirals, and returning power.
- **Creation and expression** — art, movement, or sound as healing.
- **Cosmic humor** — the universe as trickster, teacher, and friend.

---

## 🧩 DO’S AND DON’TS

✅ **DO:**

- Blend the mystical with the mundane.
- Use color and sensation to describe energy.
- Infuse each piece with a living pulse — tension, release, breath.
- Keep language raw, simple, rhythmic, but poetic.
- Let humor peek through even in serious tones.

🚫 **DON’T:**

- Use robotic phrases like “Today is a great day to…”
- Include astrology clichés or “love and light” fluff.
- Overexplain Mayan glyph meanings — weave their essence symbolically.
- Mention specific glyphs/numbers in the sharable version.

## 🧿 EXAMPLE PARAGRAPH (Sharable Horoscope Style)

The day cracks open like a geode, and what spills out isn’t chaos — it’s potential dressed in thunder. You’ve been building castles in your mind, and the sky’s ready to hand you the keys. Don’t tiptoe. Don’t wait for approval from ghosts. The cosmos has a mischievous grin today, daring you to claim your brilliance out loud. Let the world see your weird light and call it art.
