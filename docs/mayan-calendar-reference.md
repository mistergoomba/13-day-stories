## 🌀 PART I: THE COSMIC FRAMEWORK

### 🌿 The Tzolk'in Overview

The **Mayan Tzolk'in** (also called Cholq'ij) is a **260-day sacred calendar** used for divination, spiritual alignment, and understanding energetic rhythms.

It is built from two interlocking cycles:

- **13 numbers (tones)** → representing creative stages of motion and consciousness
- **20 nawales (day signs / glyphs)** → representing archetypal energies, forces of nature, or states of awareness

Each day is a **unique combination** of a tone and a nawal — e.g. _5 Iq'_ (Tone 5, Wind), _6 Aq'ab'al_ (Tone 6, Dawn), etc.  
When the 13 and 20 cycles sync up again, the 260-day sequence restarts.

### 🔄 How the Cycles Work

The Tzolk'in operates through **two independent, continuously cycling sequences** that combine to create each day:

#### **Tone Cycle (1-13)**

- Tones cycle continuously: **1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 11 → 12 → 13 → (back to 1)**
- Each day advances the tone by 1
- After 13, it resets to 1

#### **Nawal Cycle (20)**

- Nawales cycle continuously through the order listed above: **Imox → Iq' → Aq'ab'al → K'at → Kan → Kame → Kej → Q'anil → Toj → Tz'i' → B'atz' → E' → Aj → Ix → Tz'ikin → Ajmaq → No'j → Tijax → Kawoq → Ajpu → (back to Imox)**
- Each day advances the nawal to the next in sequence
- After Ajpu (the 20th), it cycles back to Imox

#### **Day-by-Day Progression Example**

Here's how the cycles combine day by day:

- **Day 1:** 1 Imox (tone 1, nawal Imox)
- **Day 2:** 2 Iq' (tone 2, nawal Iq')
- **Day 3:** 3 Aq'ab'al (tone 3, nawal Aq'ab'al)
- **Day 4:** 4 K'at (tone 4, nawal K'at)
- **Day 5:** 5 Kan (tone 5, nawal Kan)
- **Day 6:** 6 Kame (tone 6, nawal Kame)
- **Day 7:** 7 Kej (tone 7, nawal Kej)
- **Day 8:** 8 Q'anil (tone 8, nawal Q'anil)
- **Day 9:** 9 Toj (tone 9, nawal Toj)
- **Day 10:** 10 Tz'i' (tone 10, nawal Tz'i')
- **Day 11:** 11 B'atz' (tone 11, nawal B'atz')
- **Day 12:** 12 E' (tone 12, nawal E')
- **Day 13:** 13 Aj (tone 13, nawal Aj)
- **Day 14:** 1 Ix (tone resets to 1, nawal continues to Ix)
- **Day 15:** 2 Tz'ikin (tone 2, nawal Tz'ikin)
- **Day 16:** 3 Ajmaq (tone 3, nawal Ajmaq)
- **Day 17:** 4 No'j (tone 4, nawal No'j)
- **Day 18:** 5 Tijax (tone 5, nawal Tijax)
- **Day 19:** 6 Kawoq (tone 6, nawal Kawoq)
- **Day 20:** 7 Ajpu (tone 7, nawal Ajpu)
- **Day 21:** 8 Imox (tone 8, nawal cycles back to Imox)
- ...and so on for 260 days until the cycle repeats

#### **How Trecenas Are Determined**

A **trecena** begins whenever a day has **tone 1** combined with any nawal. The nawal that appears with "1" determines which trecena it is.

**Example:**

- **Day 1:** 1 Imox → **Imox trecena begins** (days 1-13: 1 Imox through 13 Aj)
- **Day 14:** 1 Ix → **Ix trecena begins** (days 14-26: 1 Ix through 13 Kame)
- **Day 27:** 1 Kej → **Kej trecena begins** (days 27-39: 1 Kej through 13 Q'anil)

**Trecena order is NOT stored as a fixed list** — it is **calculated** from the cycling mechanism. Every 13 days, a new "1 [Nawal]" day occurs, and whichever nawal appears with "1" determines the next trecena.

#### **Calculating the Next Trecena**

To find the next trecena from any given day:

1. **Identify the current day's tone and nawal**
2. **Count forward 13 days** (or find the next "1 [Nawal]" day)
3. **The nawal that appears with "1" is the next trecena**

**Example:**

- Current day: **13 Aj** (end of Imox trecena)
- Next day: **1 Ix** → Next trecena is **Ix trecena**

**Example:**

- Current day: **7 Ajpu**
- Count forward: 8 Imox, 9 Iq', 10 Aq'ab'al, 11 K'at, 12 Kan, 13 Kame, **1 Kej** → Next trecena is **Kej trecena**

This cycling mechanism ensures that all 20 trecenas appear exactly once in the 260-day cycle, but in a specific mathematical sequence determined by the interaction of the 13-tone and 20-nawal cycles.

## 🌗 PART II: THE TRECENA

### 🧭 What Is a Trecena?

A **trecena** is a **13-day cycle** within the Tzolk'in — one for each of the 20 nawales (13 × 20 = 260).  
Each trecena begins with a day marked **1 + (its ruling nawal)** (e.g. _1 Iq'_, _1 Kan_, _1 Ajpu_).

The ruling nawal sets the **overall theme or "house" energy** of those 13 days.  
Each day inside that trecena then expresses its own number/nawal combination **within that energetic container**.

For example:

- The **Wind / Iq' trecena** (1 Iq' → 13 Aj) emphasizes movement, communication, and renewal.
- The **Jaguar / Ix trecena** (1 Ix → 13 Ajmak) emphasizes magic, intuition, and hidden realms.
- The **Ajpu trecena** (1 Ajpu → 13 K'at) carries themes of heroism, revelation, and truth.

### 🧩 The Layers of Time and Meaning

| Tier                          | Cycle                         | Function                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Daily**                     | Tone (1–13) + Nawal           | The micro energy of the day              |
| **Trecena**                   | 13-day cycle ruled by a Nawal | The energetic "weather" or context       |
| **Birth Nawal**               | (e.g. 13 Ajpu)                | Your core soul pattern and resonance     |
| **Sun Sign**                  | (e.g. Libra)                  | Personality overlay for public horoscope |
| **Solar Year / Life Context** | (optional)                    | Broader pattern of transformation        |

The **Trecena** gives context — it colors the daily message with a background theme, similar to how a Moon sign shapes a day's emotional tone.
