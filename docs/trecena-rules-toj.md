# Trecena Toj — Creation Rules & Decisions

## World Module: The Obsidian Garden

**Core Theme:** The fertility of destruction. Paying karmic debts (Toj) creates the soil for new life.

**World Essence:**
A volatile landscape starting with intense heat, flowing magma rivers, and jagged shards of glossy black obsidian. As the trecena progresses, the fire cools into solid ground, and bioluminescent life (neon ferns, crystalline moss) begins to explode from the cracks. It transitions from a place of survival to a place of thriving alchemy.

**Key Motifs:**

- Rivers of magma vs. cooling black glass.
- The "Ember" (a recurring symbol of the debt/gift).
- Bioluminescent flora (ultraviolet moss, crystal canes).
- Steam and iridescent mist.
- The transition from Red/Black (Heat) to Teal/Gold/Indigo (Cooling/Water).

**Color Palette Progression:**

- **Days 1–4 (Fire/Earth):** Magma red, charcoal black, ash gray, intense orange.
- **Days 5–8 (Growth/Magic):** Introduction of amber, deep green, and violet (bioluminescence).
- **Days 9–12 (Clarity/Refinement):** Stark white, electric blue, laser-like gold.
- **Day 13 (Water/Spirit):** Deep teal, indigo, starlight, bioluminescent blue.

## Prologue Choice

**Option B: The Eruption of Memory**

- **Concept:** The traveler arrives by _falling_ into the world mid-eruption. They are not walking in; they are dropped into the heat.
- **Key Action:** Accepting the "Ember" (the seed of the debt) amidst the chaos.

## Epilogue Choice

**Option C: The Glass Harvest**

- **Concept:** The garden has fully cooled and bloomed. The fire is gone.
- **Key Action:** The traveler harvests a single seed of glass/light as a receipt of payment and walks into the cooling rain (transitioning to the next cycle).
